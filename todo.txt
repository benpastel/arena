# TODO: GAME RULE CHANGES

- add diagonals back?  but not for knives?

- reconsider grappler
I think we want to go back to: enemy gets pulled to you
plus diagonals
then enemy has a clear line of retreat unless you've backed them into a corner

- IMPLEMENT START CENTER STUFF
    triggers whenever you END YOUR TURN on a square

LATER:
    - randomize start positions
    - randomize center positions? can even change # of stuff and size of + points
    - instead of win/lose/draw, return scores (per kill), which update the match points


# TODO: SERVER

- BUG: grappling doesn't work on UPPER RIGHT diagonels?

- when a player wins, send a message!
    for now just ALERT
    later:
    + track the match score in a new panel
    + immediately start a new game


# TODO: UI

- move the prompt to the log somewhere?  like float it on the top or on the bottom?
    otherwise need to read multiple places...

- leave a mark on the selected action while waiting for a challenge

- enumerate the list of possible responses in the prompt?

- draw an arrow on move selections

- when highlighting a possible START, highlight the TILE not the SQUARE?

- highlight selected tile for losing (wipe highlighted target?)

- informational tooltips everywhere!!!!

LATER:
    - randomize start positions (configurable button!)
    - randomize center positions? can even change # of stuff and size of + points
    - instead of win/lose/draw, return scores (per kill), which update the match points

MAYBE:
    - draw an arrow on move selections?
    - change bird back to +1, but make center tile +2?
    - 6x5 board?
    - draw A/B on the tiles?  or give them colors?
    - bolding tiles looks weird.  change color?  alpha?  highlight?


CRITICAL:
    - don't need to select a source tile for choosing smite

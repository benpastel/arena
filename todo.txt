LATER:
    - randomize start positions (configurable button!)
    - randomize center positions? can even change # of stuff and size of + points
    - instead of win/lose/draw, return scores (per kill), which update the match points


# TODO: SERVER


# TODO: UI

- move the prompt to the log somewhere?  like float it on the top or on the bottom?
    otherwise need to read multiple places...
- COLOR the bottom bar or otherwise highlight that it's your turn (esp for exchange)


- draw an arrow on move selections

- when highlighting a possible START, highlight the TILE not the SQUARE?

- leave a mark on the selected action while waiting for a challenge
- highlight selected tile for losing (wipe highlighted target?)
- CRITICAL: indicate to player which tile lost before they replace tile
- don't need to select a source tile for choosing smite

- informational tooltips everywhere!!!!

- clickable things transform cursor into a pointer finger
- phrasing on exchanged tiles
- bolding tiles looks weird.  change color?  alpha?  highlight?

- show selected money spend in UI somehow
    in corner?


- when challenge fails, log doesn't show which identity

"may have exchanged"

MAYBE:
    - change bird back to +1, but make center tile +2?
    - 6x5 board?
    - draw A/B on the tiles?  or give them colors?

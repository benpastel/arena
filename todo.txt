# TODO: GAME RULE CHANGES

LATER:
    - randomize start positions
    - randomize center positions? can even change # of stuff and size of + points
    - instead of win/lose/draw, return scores (per kill), which update the match points


# TODO: SERVER

- tiles just changed after swap?
- maybe challenge loss should resolve after action loss

- configurable button for random start

- DID HER TILES CHANGE BEFORE SWAP???

CONSIDER: changing bird back to +1



# TODO: UI

- move the prompt to the log somewhere?  like float it on the top or on the bottom?
    otherwise need to read multiple places...

- leave a mark on the selected action while waiting for a challenge

- enumerate the list of possible responses in the prompt?

- draw an arrow on move selections

- when highlighting a possible START, highlight the TILE not the SQUARE?

- highlight selected tile for losing (wipe highlighted target?)

- informational tooltips everywhere!!!!

- clickable things transform cursor into a pointer finger
- phrasing on exchanged tiles
- bolding tiles looks weird.  change color?  alpha?  highlight?

- show selected money spend in UI somehow
    in corner?

- don't need to select a source tile for choosing smite
- CRITICAL: indicate to player which tile lost before they replace tile
- BUG: tiles swap when fail a challenge???
    failed challenge on a bird???

 - draw A/B on the tiles?  or give them colors?

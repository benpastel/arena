# TODO: GAME RULE CHANGES

- randomize start positions

- randomize center positions?  (first implement center stuff!!)

- add diagonals back?

- reconsider grappler
I think we want to go back to: enemy gets pulled to you
plus diagonals
then enemy has a clear line of retreat unless you've backed them into a corner


# TODO: SERVER
- move icons to javascript only?

- remove Response.BLOCK & clean up Action | Response

- BUG: grappling doesn't work on UPPER RIGHT diagonels?

- when a player wins, send a message!
    for now just ALERT
    later:
    + track the match score in a new panel
    + immediately start a new game


# TODO: UI
- leave a mark on the selected action while waiting for a challenge

- enumerate the list of possible responses in the prompt?

- draw an arrow on move selections

- when highlighting a possible START, highlight the TILE not the SQUARE?

- highlight selected tile for losing (wipe highlighted target?)

- display challenge success/failure in prompt or log

- disconnect BOTH players whenever either player disconnects (for now)

- hand should resize when window resizes!
